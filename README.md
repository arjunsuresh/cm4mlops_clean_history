This repository contains reusable and cross-platform automation recipes to run DevOps, MLOps, AIOps and MLPerf 
via a simple and human-readable [Collective Mind interface (CM)](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck) 
while adapting to different opearting systems, software and hardware.

All Ð¡M scripts have a simple Python API, extensible JSON/YAML meta description
and unifed input/output to make them reusable in different projects either individually 
or by chaining them together into portable automation workflows, applications 
and web services adaptable to continuously changing models, data sets, software and hardware.

These automation recipes are being developed and maintained 
by the [MLCommons Task Force on Automation and Reproducibility](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/blob/master/docs/taskforce.md)
with [great contributions](CONTRIBUTING.md) from the community.
